# DevHistory C-MVP-2: Thread Pool & In-Memory Buffer

## 1. Introduction

This document details the reconstruction of the second Minimum Viable Product (MVP2) for the C version of LogCaster. This phase marks a significant architectural evolution from the single-threaded, `select`-based model of MVP1.

The primary goals of this stage are to introduce true concurrency for handling client connections and to establish a foundation for data persistence and querying. This is achieved by implementing two core components:

1.  **Thread Pool:** A fixed-size pool of worker threads is implemented to process incoming client requests. This replaces the inefficient model of handling all logic in the main loop, allowing for genuine concurrent processing and improved scalability.
2.  **In-Memory Log Buffer:** Instead of merely printing to standard output, logs are now stored in a thread-safe circular buffer in memory. This serves as the primary data store for incoming logs and enables real-time queries.
3.  **Query Interface:** A dedicated query port (`9998`) is introduced, allowing clients to retrieve server statistics and perform basic keyword searches on the in-memory buffer.

The architecture shifts to a classic **Producer-Consumer pattern**. The main thread acts as the producer, accepting new connections and enqueuing them as jobs. The worker threads in the pool act as consumers, dequeuing jobs and performing the actual data processing.

## 2. In-depth Analysis for Technical Interviews

### Architectural Choices
- **Why a Thread Pool?**
  - **Choice:** We moved from a single-threaded `select` model to a multi-threaded model using a custom thread pool.
  - **Reasoning:** The `select`-based model, while simple, does not scale well as all processing happens serially in one loop. A thread pool allows for concurrent processing of client requests, significantly increasing throughput. By pre-creating a fixed number of threads, we avoid the high overhead of creating a new thread for every single connection, which is a common anti-pattern for high-performance servers.
- **Producer-Consumer Pattern**
  - **Choice:** The main thread accepts connections and places them in a job queue; worker threads process them.
  - **Reasoning:** This pattern decouples connection acceptance from connection processing. The main thread can remain highly responsive and dedicated to its single task: accepting new clients. The heavy lifting of reading data and writing to the log buffer is offloaded to the worker threads. This separation of concerns makes the code cleaner and more scalable.

### Data Structures & Synchronization
- **Job Queue (Linked List)**
  - **Choice:** A simple singly linked list was used for the thread pool's job queue.
  - **Reasoning:** A linked list is easy to implement and allows for an unbounded number of pending jobs (limited only by memory). For the number of threads and job rate in this MVP, the performance overhead of `malloc` for each new job is acceptable.
  - **Trade-offs:** A contiguous array-based circular queue could offer better cache performance by avoiding pointer chasing, but it is more complex to implement correctly, especially when handling wrap-around logic.
- **Log Buffer (Circular Buffer)**
  - **Choice:** A circular buffer (or ring buffer) of `log_entry_t` pointers.
  - **Reasoning:** This is a highly efficient, fixed-size data structure for storing the most recent N items. When the buffer is full, the oldest entry is overwritten, which is often the desired behavior for log caches. All operations (push, access) are O(1).
- **Synchronization Primitives**
  - **Choice:** We used standard POSIX threads primitives: `pthread_mutex_t` and `pthread_cond_t`.
  - **Reasoning:** Mutexes are used to protect shared data structures (the job queue and the log buffer) from race conditions. Condition variables are used for efficient signaling between threads. For example, worker threads can sleep (`pthread_cond_wait`) when the job queue is empty, consuming no CPU, and be woken up by the main thread (`pthread_cond_signal`) only when a new job is available. This is far more efficient than busy-waiting or polling.

### Challenges Faced & Design Decisions
- **`Makefile` Debugging**
  - **Challenge:** A significant amount of time was spent debugging the `Makefile`. The build process repeatedly failed to create the `obj` and `bin` directories before attempting to place files in them, leading to linker and compiler errors.
  - **Resolution:** The issue was resolved by making the rules for compiling object files (`.o`) and linking the final executable (`TARGET`) explicitly responsible for creating their own output directories (`@mkdir -p $(@D)` and `@mkdir -p bin`). This made the build process more robust and less dependent on the order of target execution.
- **Port Binding Failures (`Address already in use`)**
  - **Challenge:** Tests frequently failed because the server could not bind to the default ports, even after the previous process was terminated. This was caused by sockets lingering in the `TIME_WAIT` state.
  - **Resolution:** The issue was ultimately resolved by using `pkill -f logcaster-c` to ensure any and all zombie or lingering processes from previous test runs were terminated before starting a new one. This highlights the importance of robust environment cleanup in development and testing.
