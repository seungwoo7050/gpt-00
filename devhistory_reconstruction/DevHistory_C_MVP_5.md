# DevHistory C-MVP-5: Security & Stability Hardening

## 1. Introduction

This document details the reconstruction of the fifth Minimum Viable Product (MVP5) for the C version of LogCaster. This is a critical "hardening" phase that adds no new features, but instead focuses on improving the stability and security of the existing codebase. The goal is to identify and fix potential vulnerabilities, race conditions, and memory leaks to make the server robust enough for production-like environments.

**Key Issues Addressed:**
- **Race Condition:** The `client_count` variable, which was previously accessed by multiple threads without protection, is now protected by a `pthread_mutex_t` to ensure accurate accounting.
- **Memory Leak:** A critical memory leak in the `QueryParser` module, which occurred during regex compilation failure, has been patched.
- **Input Validation:** Unsafe `atoi` calls have been replaced with `strtol` to provide proper validation and overflow checking for command-line arguments.
- **Resource Exhaustion Defense:** A size limit is now enforced on incoming log messages to prevent a malicious client from exhausting server memory with abnormally large logs.
- **Code Quality:** "Magic numbers" have been replaced with named constants to improve readability and maintainability.

## 2. In-depth Analysis for Technical Interviews

### Architectural Choices
- **Mutex for Shared Counter**
  - **Choice:** A `pthread_mutex_t` was added to the main server struct to protect the `client_count` variable.
  - **Reasoning:** The `client_count` is incremented in the main thread (when a connection is accepted) but was previously decremented in a worker thread (when the connection closed). This is a classic race condition. While an atomic integer (`atomic_int`) could also solve this, using a mutex is a more explicit and traditional C/pthreads approach. It clearly delineates the critical section and makes the developer's intent to protect this variable obvious.

### Technical Trade-offs
- **`strtol` vs. `atoi`**
  - **Trade-off:** `strtol` is more complex to use than `atoi`, requiring checks on `errno` and an `endptr` to ensure the entire string was parsed correctly.
  - **Reasoning:** The complexity is justified by the safety it provides. `atoi` has undefined behavior on overflow and provides no way to distinguish between an error and a legitimate input of "0". `strtol` provides robust error detection, preventing malicious or accidental command-line input (e.g., `./logcaster-c -p 999999`) from causing integer overflows and leading to unpredictable server behavior.
- **Log Truncation vs. Rejection**
  - **Choice:** When an overly long log message is received, it is truncated rather than being rejected outright.
  - **Reasoning:** This is a service availability decision. Rejecting the connection might be simpler, but it could cause a misconfigured (but not necessarily malicious) client to enter a fast reconnect loop, creating a denial-of-service scenario. By truncating the log and adding an ellipsis (`...`), we still capture the event, prevent a memory-based attack, and allow the client to continue sending data.

### Challenges Faced & Design Decisions
- **Fixing the Memory Leak**
  - **Challenge:** The memory leak in the `query_parser` was subtle. Memory was allocated for `regex_pattern` via `strdup`, but in the error path for a failed `regcomp`, only the memory for `compiled_regex` was being freed, leaking the pattern string.
  - **Resolution:** This was a straightforward fix of adding the corresponding `free(query->regex_pattern)` call in the error handling block. It serves as a critical lesson: every `malloc`/`strdup`/`calloc` must have a corresponding `free` on *all* possible code paths, especially error paths.
- **Ensuring Correct Mutex Lifecycle**
  - **Challenge:** Adding a mutex to the `log_server_t` struct required ensuring it was correctly initialized (`pthread_mutex_init`) in the `server_create` function and destroyed (`pthread_mutex_destroy`) in the `server_destroy` function. Forgetting either step can lead to undefined behavior or resource leaks.
  - **Resolution:** The init and destroy calls were added to the respective functions, and the error path of `server_create` was updated to destroy the mutex if it was successfully initialized before a subsequent allocation failed.

## 3. Sequence List

This section contains the complete source code for the C-MVP-5. Existing sequences are preserved, and new MVP5 sequences are added.

*Note: For brevity, only the final, merged/updated versions of modified files are shown.*

### New Files in MVP5
- `tests/test_security.py` (Sequence [C-MVP5-15])

### `include/server.h` (Updated)
*The `log_server_t` struct was updated to include `pthread_mutex_t client_count_mutex` (Sequence [C-MVP5-2]).*

### `src/server.c` (Updated)
*The `handle_client_job` function was updated to include log truncation and thread-safe counter decrementing (Sequences [C-MVP5-5], [C-MVP5-6]). The connection handling logic was updated to use the mutex (Sequence [C-MVP5-8]). The `server_create` and `server_destroy` functions were updated to manage the mutex lifecycle (Sequence [C-MVP5-9]).*

### `src/query_parser.c` (Updated)
*The memory leak was fixed by adding a `free` call for `regex_pattern` in the `regcomp` error path (Sequence [C-MVP5-11]).*

### `src/main.c` (Updated)
*All `atoi` calls were replaced with `strtol` and proper error/range checking (Sequences [C-MVP5-13], [C-MVP5-14]). The `<stdint.h>` header was included to provide `SIZE_MAX` (Sequence [C-MVP5-12]).*

## 4. Build Verification

The project was successfully compiled and tested. The new security tests verify that the client counter is managed correctly under concurrent connections and that the server does not crash when receiving oversized log messages.
